%Many thanks to Jonny, Jocke, Abdelgahni, Haggstrom, electrotech and Disire.


My biggest thankfulness is going to my supervisor Jonny Johansson, for his excellent guidance and for giving me the opportunity to do this thesis. Despite his consistent fully booked schedule, he has been taking the time to see everything is moving on in the right direction and pushed me when necessary. 

I also want to thank my office mate Joakim Nilsson, for being a great source to bounce ideas and his constant willingness to help.

Working in the EISLAB department have been great five months, with friendly people around. Here Fredrik H\"{a}ggstr\"{o}m and Abdelganhi Renbi deserves special thanks. The former EISLAB member Johan Borg has also contributed with valuable information from distance.

To do this thesis as a part of the DISIRE project has been exciting, where I have gotten the opportunity to explore different locations and work environments. Electrotech, who is also involved in the DISIRE project has been very open minded when it comes to co-operations.% Here Urban Claesson has been a really valuable source when integrating stuff.


%Last but not least I would like to thank all members in the "H\"{o}rs p\r{a} m\r{a}ndag" study group. You have been making my 5 years at university to a great time.
